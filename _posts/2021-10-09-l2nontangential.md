#### Introduction

Maximal functions are naturally introduced when someone wants to study the pointwise convergence of functions. In particular, nontangential maximal functions are naturally used when we want to analyze a nontangential behavior of a function. 

When I wrote a research paper [KK19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12619), it was hard to find a proof of the following theorem.

> **Theorem.** Let $\Omega$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Suppose that $u^* \in L^2 (\partial\Omega)$. Then there exists a function $g$ in $L^2(\partial\Omega)$ such that $u\rightarrow g$ nontangentially a.e. on $\partial\Omega$. 

According to some literatures, this theorem was shown by Dahlberg. Since I am not familar with geometric measure theory, it was hard for me to follow the essence of the proof. The purpose of this post is to prove this well-known theorem by using layer potential technique. I want to point out that the proof is not original. It is well-known to experts.
