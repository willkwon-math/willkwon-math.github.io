# Introduction 
<div>
In this article, we prove the classical Aleksandrov maximum principle for the second-order elliptic operator in non-divergence form:
\[	\mathcal{L}u=a^{ij}D_{ij} u + b^i D_i u +cu,\]
where $A=[a^{ij}]$ is elliptic in $\Omega$ in the sense that $a^{ij}$ is positive on $\Omega$ and $c\leq 0$ on $\Omega$. We further assume that eigenvalues of $A$ are greater than $\lambda>0$ and less than $\Lambda$. Then the geometric mean $D^*$ of eigenvalues of $A$ satisfies $0<\lambda\leq D^* \leq\Lambda$. We further assume that $\mathbf{b} /D^* \in L_{n}(\Omega)$. 

In 1963, Aleksandrov proved the following theorem, whose proof was refined by Bakel'man and Pucci. </br>

<blockquote><strong> Theorem 1.</strong>
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $u\in  W^{2}_{n,loc}(\Omega)\cap C(\overline{\Omega})$ satisfy $\mathcal{L}u\geq f$ in $\Omega$. Then 
\[	\sup_\Omega u \leq \sup_{\partial \Omega} u^+ + C\Vert{f/D^*}\Vert_{ L_{n}(\Omega)},\]
where $C$ is a constant depending only on $n$, $ \mathrm{diam}\, \Omega$, and $\Vert{\mathbf{b}/D^*}\Vert_{ L_{n}(\Omega)}$.

One may relax the assumption $u\in W^{2}_{n,loc}(\Omega)$ to $u\in W^{2}_{p}(\Omega)$, $p<n$. However, the following example suggests that this is impossible in general. 
</div>

<blockquote><strong> Example.</strong>
Let 
\[	 a^{ij} =\delta_{ij} + b \frac{x_i x_j}{|x|^2},\quad b=-1+\frac{n-1}{1-\lambda}, \quad 0<\alpha<1,\]
where $n>2(2-\alpha)>2$. Then $u_1(x)=1$ and $u_2(x)=|x|^\alpha$ are in $W^{2}_{2}(B)$ and agreeing on $\partial B$, where $B$ is the unit ball. However, both functions are solutions of 
\[	a^{ij}D_{ij}u=0\quad \text{in } B_1.\]
This example suggests that there cannot be an Alexandrov type estimate for $\mathcal{L}=a^{ij}D_{ij}$. 
</blockquote>

<div>
The example does not mean that we cannot expect Alexandrov type estimate $W^{2}_{p}$ for any $p<n$. Recently, Krylov proved that there exists $n/2 <n_0 <n$ depending only on $\lambda$, $\Lambda$, $n$, $ \mathrm{diam}\,\Omega$, and $\mathbf{b}$ such that if $n_0\leq p<\infty$, then the following estimate 
\[	u(x)\leq \sup_{\partial \Omega} u^+ + C \Vert{(\mathcal{L}u-cu)_{-}}\Vert_{L_{p}(\Omega)}\quad \text{for all } x\in \Omega \]
holds for all $u\in W^{2}_{p,loc}(\Omega) \cap C(\overline{\Omega})$. 
This result was obtained by the probabilistic method. Another proof was obtained by Dong-Krylov by using the result of Byun-Lee-Palagachev on Hessian estimates of fully nonlinear equations. The novelty of this result is to allow Morrey drifts $\mathbf{b}$ although the domain is restricted to $B_R$.

Here I do not claim that the proof of this theorem is not original. Mostly, I follow the proof given in the textbook of Qing Han and Gilbarg-Trudinger. 

# Proof of the Alexandrov maximum principle  

<div>
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $u\in C(\Omega)$. We define a subset $\Gamma^+$ of $\Omega$ as follows: $y\in\Gamma^+$ if and only if there exists $p=p(y)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $u(x)\leq u(y)+ p\cdot(y-x)$ for all $x\in\Omega$. We call $\Gamma^+$ the <em>upper contact set</em> of $u$. Similarly, we can define the <em>lower contact set</em> of $u$. The upper contact set is the set of all points whose tangent hyperplane lies above the graph of $u$. <br>
  
<strong>Remark.</strong> (a) Suppose that  $u$ is differentiable on $\Omega$. Then 
\[ y\in 	\Gamma^+ \quad \text{if and only if } u(x)\leq u(y)+ \nabla u(y)\cdot (y-x)\quad \text{for all } x\in \Omega.\]
 Since $\Omega$ is open, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $B_\delta (x)\subset \Omega$. Note that for $0<h<\delta$ and $x=y+he_j$, we have 
\[	u(y+he_j)-u(y)\leq p_j h.\]
Since $u$ is differentiable, it follows that $D_ju(y)\leq p_j$. Similarly, we also have $p_j \leq D_j u(y)$. Hence, $p=\nabla u(y)$.   </br>

(b) If $u$ is twice differentiable in $\Omega$, then $-\nabla^2 u$ is positive semidefinite on $\Gamma^+$. Note that $\Gamma^+$ is relatively closed in $\Omega$. We write 
\[	\Gamma^+ = C_1 \cup C_2 \cup \cdots \cup C_k,\]
where $C_i$ is a connected component of $\Gamma^+$. Hence we may assume that $\Gamma^+=\Omega$. Then one can easily show that $u$ is concave on $\Omega$.  Define 
\[	v(t)=u(x+t\xi).\]
Then $v$ is concave around $0$ and $v''(0)\leq 0$. By the chain rule, 
\[	v'(t)= u_{x_i} (x+t\xi) \xi_i\]
and 
\[	v''(t)=u_{x_i x_j}(x+t\xi) \xi_i \xi_j \]
for $\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n$. By plugging $t=0$, we see that $\nabla^2 u$ is nonpositive on $\Gamma^+$.
