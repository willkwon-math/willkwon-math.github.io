I wrote it in [Korean first](https://brunch.co.kr/@skykite9/35) and I rewrote it in English. Hopely, the writing is not that awkward.

I cannot remember where I saw the link (probably Facebook or LinkedIn). Someone made a toolkit for writing a paper that checks references and writing at the same time. While I agree that AI could greatly shape one's point of view, I am highly skeptical of relying on generative AI to write a paper.

Writing a mathematics paper is a writing between poetry and a novel. It needs to be concise, like poetry, and explained well so the reader can understand the problem's key difficulty. Although mathematics research paper is nonfiction, it needs a sort of elegance in elaborating the logic and it should contain some logical thinking so that people can be touched.

Many of the great papers that I read were in that category. For instance, the famous [Landau damping paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2760) by Mouhot and Villani clearly explains why this problem is important and elaborates on its key difficulties. Also, they explain the whole strategy for managing all difficulties. Another reason that I like this paper is that it appreciates people who discuss the problem with them. Creating a new language to explain the mysterious phenomenon can be achieved through fruitful discussions with people, not from a single brilliant mind. Moreover, this paper also explains potential different directions so that future researchers can get some benefit. This kind of mind was a driving force that enabled humans to achieve this outstanding civilization.
 
I also like the fundamental paper due to J. Leray written in 1934, [Sur le mouvement d'un liquide visqueux emplissant l'espace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02484). It explains many efforts by engineers, physicists, and mathematicians to understand the motion of viscous fluids. After Navier introduced the model, J. Leray sought to justify it by introducing a new framework. This is now called the theory of weak solutions. In this paper, he proved the global existence of turbulent solutions (now it is called the Leray-Hopf weak solution). To show this, he invented a revolutionary idea to construct a weak solution. Not only for constructing this solution, but he also investigated a limitation of this solution by introducing an epoch of regularity. While this paper was written 90 years ago, I can see how he thought about this problem, and his perspective amuses me. Modern PDE theory did not deviate that much from this paper.

I heard that someone created a review website for an AI paper from Stanford. If the user uploads the paper as a PDF, the AI will evaluate it and provide feedback. [Link](https://paperreview.ai)

It seems this tool was created because publishing a paper on AI is too competitive. I don't know how to think. I believe that humankind chose to be destructive. Now we have lost lots of critical thinking, and many writings have become homogeneous. 

90% of research papers will be forgotten. Many people will not listen to how to write a good paper in the extreme era of publish-or-perish.

Now I kept thinking how to write a good article to touch the reader. That's why I kept reading literature these days to get some idea.
