Yesterday, while I am attending ICERM conference on [fluid dynamics and turbluence]("https://icerm.brown.edu/program/hot_topics_workshop/htw-25-fdt"), I learned from [Nestor]("https://www.ndguillen.com/") that there is another way to look at the Alexandrov maximum principle via convex geometry.
I appreciate his passion for sharing this knowledge.
