## Mathematics
 
Below are some notes I have written up for some courses I have taken or I gave. (Very Rough!)

- [2018-1 Geometric Analysis: Yamabe Problem and Geometric flow](https://willkwon-math.github.io/assets/files/lecture-notes(Geometric_analysis).pdf) (Sogang University, Mathematics, [Prof. Pak Tung Ho](http://maths.sogang.ac.kr/ptho)) / daily updated (last updated: 2018-06-08)
- [2017-1 General Relativity](https://willkwon-math.github.io/assets/files/lecture-notes(General_Relativity).pdf)  (Sogang University, Physics,  [Prof. Jeong-Hyuck Park](http://lab7616.sogang.ac.kr/lab7616/1093.html)) / revised (2019-02-08)


The following notes are available upon request (incomplete note)

- Existence of forward self-similar solution of Navier-Stokes for large initial data (review note of the work of Jia-Sverak)
- Lectures on elliptic and parabolic equations on Holder spaces (based on the book of Krylov)
- Introduction to Random process (based on the book of Krylov)
- Littlewood-Paley theory and Kato-Ponce inequality (based on the paper of Dong Li, Fractional Leibniz rules and Kato-Ponce inequality)
