## About me 
 
  I'm Hyunwoo Kwon. I am a full-time lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at [Republic of Korea Air Force Academy](http://www.afa.ac.kr). Also I am a Ph. D. student(leave of absence due to military service) in the Department of Mathematics, Sogang University. Previously, I did my master in mathematics at [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html). My advisor was Prof. [Hyunseok Kim](http://maths.sogang.ac.kr/kimh/).  

[Here](http://willkwon.dothome.co.kr) is my personal mathematics blog site.

Here is my [CV](https://willkwon-math.github.io/assets/files/CV_HKwon.pdf).

The drawing was given by one of my students at Republic of Korea Air Force Academy [@cute_bae_am](https://instagram.com/cute_bae_am).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie on analysis and PDEs. More precisely, I am working and interested on the following topics:
- boundary value problems for elliptic and parabolic equations with singular drift terms
- dynamics of solutions of fluid equations such as Navier-Stokes equation and Euler equations
- dynamics of solutions of kinetic and dispersive equations
- real-variable methods in harmonic analysis
