## About me 
 
  I'm Hyunwoo Kwon(a.k.a. Will Kwon). I am a full-time lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at [Republic of Korea Air Force Academy](http://www.afa.ac.kr). Previously, I did my master in mathematics at [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html). My advisor was Prof. [Hyunseok Kim](http://maths.sogang.ac.kr/kimh/).  

[Here](http://willkwon.dothome.co.kr) is my personal mathematics blog site.

Here is my [CV](https://willkwon-math.github.io/assets/files/CV_HKwon.pdf).

The drawing was given by one of my students at Republic of Korea Air Force Academy [@cute_bae_am](https://instagram.com/cute_bae_am).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie on analysis and PDEs. More precisely, I am working and interested on the following topics:
- boundary value problems for elliptic and parabolic equations with singular drift terms
- dynamics of solutions of equations arisen from physics
- real-variable methods in harmonic analysis

<summary>1. Elliptic equations with drifts in $L^2$ on Lipschitz domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$, <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01300">arXiv:2104.01300 [math.AP]</a></summary>
<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.**  We consider the Dirichlet problems for second-order elliptic equations with singular drifts given by b. When the leading coefficients $A$ have small mean oscillations in small balls and $\mathrm{div}\,A$, $\mathbf{b}$ are in $L^2$, we obtain $W^{1,p}$-results on bounded Lipschitz domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with small Lipschitz constants.

Appl. 500(1) (2021) 125165, <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022247X21002444">[Journal]</a>,  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07524">arXiv:2011.07524 [math.AP]</a></summary>

**Abstract.**  We consider the following Dirichlet problems for elliptic equations with singular drift $\mathbf{b}$:
<center>
$\text{(a)}\, −\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)+\mathrm{div}(u\mathbf{b})=f,\qquad\text{(b)}\, −\mathrm{div}(A^T\nabla v)−\mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla v=g\quad \text{in } \Omega,$
</center>
where $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. Assuming that $\mathbf{b}\in L^{n,\infty}(\Omega)^n$ has non-negative weak divergence in $\Omega$, we establish existence and uniqueness of weak solution in $W^{1,2+\varepsilon}_0(\Omega)$  of the problem (b) when $A$ is bounded and uniformly elliptic. As an application, we prove unique solvability of weak solution $u$ in $W^{1,2-}_0(\Omega)$ for the problem (a) for every $f\in W^{-1,2-}(\Omega)$.

<summary>3. Dirichlet and Neumann problems for elliptic equations with singular drifts on Lipschitz domain, with H. Kim, <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12619"> arXiv:1811.12619 [math.AP] </a>
</summary>
<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.**  We consider the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for second-order linear elliptic equations:
<center>
$−\triangle u+\mathrm{div}(u\mathbf{b})=f\quad \text{and}\quad  −\triangle v−\mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla v=g$
</center>
in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 3$), where $\mathbf{b}:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a given vector field. Under the assumption that $\mathbf{b}\in L^n(\Omega)^n$, we first establish existence and uniqueness of solutions in $L^p_{\alpha}(\Omega)$ for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Here $L^p_{\alpha}(\Omega)$ denotes the Sobolev space (or Bessel potential space) with the pair $(\alpha,p)$ satisfying certain conditions. These results extend the classical works of Jerison-Kenig (1995, JFA) and Fabes-Mendez-Mitrea (1998, JFA) for the Poisson equation. We also prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Dirichlet problem with boundary data in $L^2(\partial\Omega)$.
