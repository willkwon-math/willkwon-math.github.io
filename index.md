## About me 
 
  I'm Hyunwoo Kwon. I am a full-time lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at [the Republic of Korea Air Force Academy](http://www.afa.ac.kr). 

  Previously, I did my master in mathematics at [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html). My advisor was Prof. [Hyunseok Kim](http://maths.sogang.ac.kr/kimh/).  

[Here](http://willkwon.dothome.co.kr) is my personal mathematics blog site.

Here is my CV [CV](https://willkwon-math.github.io/assets/CV_HKwon.pdf).

## Research Interests

I am interested in the theory of partial differential equations. More precisely, I am interested in the solvability and regularity theory of elliptic and parabolic equations (existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of weak solutions). Also, I am interested in the same questions on several equations arisen from quantum mechanics and fluid mechanics.
