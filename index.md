## About me  

I am Ph. D. candidate in [the Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu). My thesis advisor is Prof. [Hongjie Dong](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/people/hongjie-dong). Previously, I worked as a researcher in the Department of Mathematics at [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html). I was an assistant professor and lecturer (with the rank Lieutenant) in the Department of Mathematics at [Republic of Korea Air Force Academy](http://www.afa.ac.kr). I did my Bachelor and Master in [mathematics](https://math.sogang.ac.kr) at [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html). My master thesis advisor was Prof. [Hyunseok Kim](http://maths.sogang.ac.kr/kimh/).

<summary>2. Scattering of Vlasov-Riesz systems in the three dimensions, with W. Huang </summary>
<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.** We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Vlasov-Riesz system of order $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is a kinetic model induced by Riesz interaction. We prove the global existence of solutions to this system of order $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ when $\alpha \in (1/2,1+\delta)\setminus\{1\}$ and the initial data is sufficiently small. These solutions exhibit scattering when $\alpha<1$ and modified scattering when $\alpha>1$. Moreover, we show the existence of wave/modified-wave operators for such a regime. To the best of our knowledge, the result presented in this paper is the first result on the existence of polynomial corrective modified scattering in kinetic models.

<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.** In this paper, we investigate a Stokes-Magneto system with fractional diffusions. We first deal with the non-resistive case in $\mathbb{T}^d$ and establish the local and global well-posedness with initial magnetic field $\boldsymbol{b}_0\in H^s(\mathbb{T}^d)$. We also show the existence of a unique mild solution of the resisitive case with initial data $\boldsymbol{b}_0$ in the critical $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ space. Moreover, we show that the $L^p$-norm of $\boldsymbol{b}(t)$ converges to zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$ if the initial data is sufficiently small.

<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.** We obtain weighted mixed norm Sobolev estimates in the whole space for nonstationary Stokes equations in divergence and nondivergence form with variable viscosity coefficients that are merely measurable in time variable and have small mean oscillation in spatial variables in small cylinders. As an application, we prove interior mixed norm derivative estimates for solutions to both equations. We also discuss boundary mixed norm Hessian estimates for solutions to equations in nondivergence form under the Lions boundary conditions.

<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.** We consider a Stokes-Magneto system  in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 2)$ with fractional diffusions   $\Lambda^{2\alpha}\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\Lambda^{2\beta}\boldsymbol{b}$ for the velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$ and the magnetic field $\boldsymbol{b}$, respectively. Here $\alpha,\beta$ are positive constants and $\Lambda^s = (-\Delta)^{s/2}$ is the fractional Laplacian of order $s$. We establish global existence of weak solutions of the  Stokes-Magneto system   for any initial data in $L_{2}$ when $\alpha$, $\beta$ satisfy $1/2<\alpha<(d+1)/2$, $\beta >0$,
and $\min(\alpha+\beta,2\alpha+\beta-1)>d/2$. It is also shown that weak solutions are   unique  if $\beta \geq 1$ and $\min (\alpha+\beta,2\alpha+\beta-1)\geq d/2+1$, in addition.

**Abstract.**  We consider the Dirichlet problem for second-order linear elliptic equations in divergence form

in bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where $A:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2^2}$, $\mathbf{b}: \Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, and $\lambda \geq 0$ are given. If $2<p<\infty$ and $A$ has a small mean oscillation in small balls, $\Omega$ has small Lipschitz constant, and $\mathrm{div } A, \mathbf{b}\in L^2(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^2)$, then we prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)$ of the problem. Similar result also holds for the dual problem.

<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.**  We consider the following Dirichlet problems for elliptic equations with singular drift $\mathbf{b}$:
<center>
$\text{(a)}\, −\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)+\mathrm{div}(u\mathbf{b})=f,\qquad\text{(b)}\, −\mathrm{div}(A^T\nabla v)−\mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla v=g\quad \text{in } \Omega,$
</center>
where $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. Assuming that $\mathbf{b}\in L^{n,\infty}(\Omega)^n$ has non-negative weak divergence in $\Omega$, we establish existence and uniqueness of weak solution in $W^{1,2+\varepsilon}_0(\Omega)$  of the problem (b) when $A$ is bounded and uniformly elliptic. As an application, we prove unique solvability of weak solution $u$ in $W^{1,2-}_0(\Omega)$ for the problem (a) for every $f\in W^{-1,2-}(\Omega)$.

<div markdown="1">
**Abstract.**  We consider the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for second-order linear elliptic equations:
<center>
$−\triangle u+\mathrm{div}(u\mathbf{b})=f\quad \text{and}\quad  −\triangle v−\mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla v=g$
</center>
in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 3$), where $\mathbf{b}:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a given vector field. Under the assumption that $\mathbf{b}\in L^n(\Omega)^n$, we first establish existence and uniqueness of solutions in $L^p_{\alpha}(\Omega)$ for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Here $L^p_{\alpha}(\Omega)$ denotes the Sobolev space (or Bessel potential space) with the pair $(\alpha,p)$ satisfying certain conditions. These results extend the classical works of Jerison-Kenig (1995) and Fabes-Mendez-Mitrea (1998) for the Poisson equation. We also prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Dirichlet problem with boundary data in $L^2(\partial\Omega)$. Our results for the Dirichlet problems hold even for the case $n=2$.

- My favorite quotes
  - 不爲也, 非不能也 (孟子) / A lack of effort, not a lack of ability. (Mencius) [translation source](http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/mencius.html)
  - It is not only courage to boldly jump into a dangerous place. It is also courage to ignore the strong temptation to jump in and go on my own path silently. It is foolish to react immediately when a reverse flow occurs in a forward flow. Maintaining your current flow when your opponent has reversed flow becomes countercurrent from the opponent's point of view. Therefore, the attitude of maintaining my flow without wavering is the best defense and offensive means. (Changho Lee, one of the best "baduk(Go)" player) [translated by Google]
