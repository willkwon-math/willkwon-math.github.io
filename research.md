# Research

From Newton's mechanics, many scientists and mathematicians have devoted to studying differential equations to explain the several phenomenon in the natures.  It is a natural to ask whether we can solve the boundary value problems of given partial differential equations. If we know an existence of solution of the problem, one can also ask some properties of solutions that have. 

## Elliptic equations with singular drift terms

For several years, I have devoted to studying unique solvability of linear elliptic equations with singular drift terms  in Sobolev spaces.  To explain the results, let $\Omega$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. For a fixed constant $\lambda \geq 0$, we consider the following Dirichlet problems of elliptic equations of   second-order: 
<center>
$ -\mathrm{div}(A \nabla u)+\mathrm{div}(u\mathbf{b})=f\quad \text{in } \Omega\qquad u=0\quad \text{on } \partial\Omega$
</center>
and 
<center>
$ -\mathrm{div}(A \nabla v)-\mathbf{b}\cdot \nabla v =g\quad \text{in } \Omega\qquad v=0\quad \text{on } \partial\Omega$
</center>
Here $A=(a^{ij}):\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ denotes an $n\times n$ real matrix-valued function  which is uniformly elliptic, that is, there exists $0<\delta<1$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uniformly-elliptic} 
\delta|\xi|^2 \leq a^{ij}(x)\xi_i \xi_j\quad \text{and}\quad |a^{ij}(x)|\leq \delta^{-1}\quad    \text{for all } x,\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n, 
\end{equation}
$\mathbf{b}=(b^1,b^2,\dots,b^n) : \Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a given vector field. Here we follow the usual summation convention for repeated indices.

During the master course, I wrote a research article [[KK18]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12619) with my academic advisor Prof. Hyunseok Kim. At the Republic of Korea Air Force Academy, I wrote two research articles [[K20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022247X21002444) and [[K21]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01300).
