# Learning seminars on free surface flows

## Goal

The goal of the learning seminar held at Brown is to study the well-posedness problems of the evolution of the free surface separating air from an incompressible perfect fluid. Necessary mathematics tools will be introduced as a crash course.

## Time/Venue

Every Wednesday 10:00 â€“ 11:15 (US Eastern Time) / Location : Kassar 205 (Zoom Hybrid)

## Contents and tentative schedule

Mainly I will review the work of Benoit and Hongjie. I will mainly get into the one-phase Muskat problem case but I will give brief explanation for two-phase case as well. 

- Reformulation of the Muskat problem via the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator
- Construction of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator
- A crash course on paradifferential calculus
- A good unknown of Alinhac and continuity estimates for Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
- Local well-posedness of Muskat problem for subcritical Sobolev initial data
I-III
- A crash course on layer potential theory
- Global well-posedness of one-phase Muskat problem for periodic Lipschitz
data I-III

## Courselog
9/11 - We introduced the Muskat problem and reformulated the original problem via the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator<br>
9/18 - We proved the continuity of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator from $H^{1/2}$ to $H^{-1/2}$. Moreover, we explained a motivation to study paradifferential calculus.
